## 1. Description

A website that allows users to look up information and book various tours around Belfast and Northern Ireland.

This was the first full website that I created. Up to this point I had created various separate components while learning (e.g. navbars, cards and accordions) but I thought that it was time to kick it up a gear and create a full, multi-paged hosted website.

I decided to go with Bootstrap and SCSS in order to speed up development time on this project and later made the decision to concatenate/minify the CSS & JS in order to decrease page load times.
